# Campaign Expectations
 Before beginning the campaign, you should establish the following expectations with your players:

* ***Tone***. This will be a heroic fantasy adventure in a dark fantasy/gothic horror setting. Your character should be a hero, or have the potential to swiftly become a hero when faced with a life-or-death situation. Be prepared to cooperate and collaborate with the other players in order to succeed.
* ***Theme***. While this campaign will not explore or focus upon your character's personal backstory, you should allow the campaign's characters and setting to inspire your  character to confront their own regrets, traumas, flaws, and fears.
* ***Engagement***. This campaign takes place in a setting with a deep history, including complex relationships between several dozen non-player characters. You should expect to take notes and take a sincere interest in the lore of this world.
* ***Tactics & Difficulty.***. This campaign has been balanced to present a challenging, but fair gameplay experience. However, to succeed, you will often need to recruit additional allies while avoiding alienating potential enemies. Consider the consequences of your actions carefully, and avoid taking actions without careful consideration.
* ***Roleplay***. This campaign is primarily driven by the stories of its non-player characters, and their relationships to the party. Be prepared to form meaningful relationships with the characters you encounter, and allow yourself to emotionally invest in those characters' success.
* ***Rewards***. Treasure, magic items, and other material rewards will be far more scarce than in an ordinary fantasy campaign. Instead, most rewards will take the form of allies, information, and new story hooks, with experience points awarded for narrative milestones you achieve as you proceed through the campaign.
* ***Narrative***. The campaign begins with a linear structure, but soon evolves into a more expansive sandbox. Be prepared to balance and prioritize multiple quests, including many with clear deadlines.

# DM Expectations
- ***Storytelling over mechanics.*** D&D campaigns are at their core story generation engines: The players create stories using their characters with the DM providing help by playing NPCs and resolving interactions with the world. The mechanics are a vehicle for those stories, but shouldn't take precedence. D&D is not a board game where the goal is to accumulate gear, treasure and XP; those are side effects and rewards for character progression, but a means to an end, not the end itself. So treating D&D like a board game will result in a worse experience for everyone, including the player themselves. There are a couple of ways this can manifest, illustrated by the bad example of Dave, and the good example of Ben.
	- ***Overprepping mechanics over character.*** Dave and the dungeoneering gear on a boat vs Ben and the band.
	- ***Winning at D&D.*** Dave frisking the rogue vs Ben praising the rogue for his finds.
	- ***Metagaming.*** Dave using map knowledge to break down the wall vs Ben finding the hidden door in the closet.
	- ***"Yes, and" instead of "No, but".*** Tavern recruitment roleplay to fetch valuables, with failed Insight check, from Dave's perspective ("The guy looks like he's lying, but I trust him anyway") vs Ben's perspective ("He's super sus, so I'll squeeze him and accidentally make it super awkward").
- ***Rule of cool.*** 
- ***DM roleplaying evil characters does not mean their being a dick to you.*** 

# Triggers & Accommodations
Our aim is to create a memorable and enjoyable gothic horror experience for everyone involved. To that end, it's essential to address any potentially uncomfortable or controversial topics before beginning your *Curse of Strahd* adventure. During Session Zero, we encourage open and honest communication with your players about their personal boundaries and any elements of the campaign that may require modification or removal.

A list of potentially uncomfortable topics you might want to discuss with your players before beginning the campaign includes:

* Child abuse and death (e.g., the Durst children)
* Torture and mutilation (e.g., Kasimir's severed ears)
* Mind control (e.g., Strahd's ***charm*** ability)
* (Implied) incest (e.g., the Belviews)
* Stalking and (symbolic) sexual assault (e.g., Strahd's obsession with Ireena)
* Suicide (e.g., Tatyana's death)
* Drug addiction (e.g., the dream pastries)
* Body horror (e.g., the vestiges' dark gifts)
* Racism (e.g., Barovian views of the Vistani)
# Campaign Contract
To ensure all players are on the same page when beginning the campaign, consider having each player review and/or sign the following "campaign contract" during Session Zero:

<div class="description">
<p>I, <strong>&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;</strong>, understand and agree to the following expectations:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>I will make and play a character who is—while potentially flawed—either (a) actively heroic; or (b) a sociable, cooperative character who inevitably and actively begins growing towards heroism within the first five sessions.</li>
<li>I will allow my character to feel true, powerless fear when faced with an overwhelming threat, and allow that fear to impact my character's actions, growth, and development.</li>
<li>I will make every reasonable effort to build meaningful short- and long-term relationships with NPCs, and allow myself to become emotionally invested in their lives and goals.</li> 
<li>This campaign requires alliances and cooperation with NPCs and other players, rather than paranoia or antisocial behavior.</li> 
<li>The DM will not try to trick me, and will give me a fair chance to avoid bad situations through clear foreshadowing. However, NPCs will withhold nonessential lore and character information unless specifically requested.</li>
<li>This campaign will largely focus on social encounters, investigations, and exploration, and combat may occur as infrequently as once every two or three sessions.</li> 
<li>Treasure, magic items, and expensive spell components will be rare and infrequently obtained, with most rewards taking the form of relationships and alliances with friendly NPCs.</li>
<li>This campaign will take place in a "fish-out-of-water" setting, and elements from my character's backstory will not directly appear or be referenced in the campaign.</li>
<li>It is my sole responsibility to collaborate with the DM and other players to provide my character with an internal emotional character arc if desired.</li> 
<li>Some powerful enemies will be impossible to defeat through combat, and that we will need to either gain levels, allies, or resources in order to do so.</li>
<li>Creature alignments and morality will not always be determined by their species or type. Some monsters can be neutral, or even friendly, while some humanoids can be monstrously irredeemable.</li>
<li>The DM has balanced any expected combat encounters to make a TPK unlikely unless we make poor decisions; should a TPK occur, the party may have an opportunity to "fail forward" and continue the campaign, albeit with severe consequences.</li> 
<li>This campaign has altered the statistics for many official D&D 5e monsters, and has introduced additional mechanics or altered statistics for other enemies to create a balanced, high-tension combat experience that may differ from the <em>Monster Manual</em> and other official supplements.</li>
<li>I will not seek out any information, artwork, videos, or other media relevant to Curse of Strahd, or any characters, locations, or lore within the campaign.</li> 
</ul>

> [!warning]+ **Breaking the Fourth Wall**
> Sometimes, a player will act in a way that seems to break the [[#Campaign Contract]]. (For example, a frustrated, trigger-happy, or mistrustful player might plot to attack and kill an NPC that can be allied or befriended.) When this happens, don't hesitate to pause the game, remind the player of the relevant provision of the campaign contract, and ensure everyone is on the same page before resuming play.

# House rules
The aim here is keep the action running smoothly by reducing dead time and breaks in play, and focusing on the story and characters instead of the mechanics.
- ***Rolling initiative at breaks in the story.*** Rolling initiative at the start of combat slows down the pace massively and often leads to side chatter and people getting distracted right when the most intense and exciting action happens. Instead, roll initiative for the next encounter at the start of the session, after a short or long rest, or at other convenient breaks in play (e.g. players leaving a location). This way, play isn't interrupted and the party can jump right into the fight when combat starts. The DM will pre-roll initiative for all encounters as part of session prep.
- ***Milestone XP.*** Nowadays, a lot of DMs use milestone XP (i.e. getting XP for story milestones) instead of awarding XP for every monster. This reduces the noise and distraction at the end of combat, and lets people jump straight away into their post-combat actions (e.g. stabilising team members, looking for loot, etc). It also makes encounter balancing much easier for the DM because milestones come in a much more predictable order. Milestones are alos more flexible than just killing some enemies, e.g. the party could level up for finding treasure, solving a mystery, etc.
	- ***No random encounters.*** Many people still consider random encounters a key ingredient for D&D but it feels like throwbacks to the dungeon crawling days, before narrative started becoming more important. Combat for combat's sake, without any story connection or post-combat rewards, is pointless, it just takes up session time and makes it harder to balance encounters for the day since the party resource drain is much less predictable.
- ***Rolling hit points for enemies.*** Not all people are built the same, even adventurers of the same species, class and level have different attributes. It makes sense that enemies would differ, too, but to keep it simple, only in hit points. D&D already supports this as every monster comes with a "roll for hit points" stat as well as a fixed hit points stat. In addition to making encounters more varied, realistic and narratively colourful (one bandit is tall and burly, one short and skinny, indicating higher and lower than standard hit points respectively), thereby providing opportunities for more in-character combat descriptions ("I shoot the big guy because he's going to be more dangerous!"), it also counteracts the metagaming strategy where players try to figure out what the maxmimum hit points for this type of monster is. If that's not possible due to randomisation, then that strategy has no value, so ideally players have to act more in-character, e.g. targeting the guy that already took a few hits and is swaying.
- ***One check only.*** If something requires an ability check, only one of the players can take it, although other players can assist. This aims to discourage round-robin-rolls where everyone gives it a go until it starts working. The in-world explanation is that the check determines which of the possible realities the party lives in: If the door couldn't be broken down with the barbarian's athletics check, then that means that the door turned out to be very sturdy. The barbarian didn't just suddenly become weaker, it's that the door was tough. If the barbarian or another party member tries again, that doesn't change the outcome, the door is still too sturdy to be broken down.
- ***Take 10.*** Older versions of D&D had the concept of "Take 10": A player could spend 10 minutes doing something that required a skill check and could then treat the outcome of the skill check as if they had rolled a 10 (on top of which any modifiers are applied). This is a workaround to "one check only" by letting the player take their time on the check to get the outcome they would get on average based on their skills; the catch here is that the party often doesn't have 10 minutes to spare. It's useful if the party wants to invest time to guarantee a success on a medium (DC 15) challenge for a skilled party member, but it also precludes any opportunity to get lucky on a hard challenge.
- ***Rolling checks.*** Some checks continue for a fixed duration or until something significant changes. If the party rolled well on stealth, then they will continue to be stealthy, i.e. every enemy observer has to check their passive perception against the stealth roll. The party only needs to reroll once a major change occurred, e.g. they get into a fight, or they alert guards while picking a lock.

Background:
- Grew up as an orphan, connected with an older Vistani traveller who brought him trinkets and stories
- Strong ties to dwarves due to economic ties between tribes
- Fascination with stars and star charts for navigation
- Tattoos as a way of commemorating history

Full write-up:
Hjalmar chose tattoos as he doesn’t see it done, in a tribe full of stone carvings (too cliche!) and wood (too traded). No, the ultimate memorial for the self should be the self, and when one day he dies valiantly defending his tribe (found or otherwise). His character gets his tattoos done primarily by this one nomad who, no matter where he goes, he seems to bump into (like that moogle Stitlzkin in FFIX). They share a special bond, as he was one of the first friends he made outside of the orphanage when he was finally adopted, and was a kind of uncle/godfather to him. That uncle came and went, and always brought news of his travels, which a young Hjal would gobble up with wide eyes and a restless spirit. Uncle rolled with a group of troubadours and mercs who ran a racket touring, solving problems on adventures and putting on a great show. It’s a simple arrangement - on the road the mercs provide protection, and when they land in a town the show attracts business.

They live under the mountains (lotsa stones!) and in doing so they do frequently find themselves coming across the company of dwarves. Diplomacy is crucial to their existence as their arrangements with local dwarf clans provide opportunities for stable trade as well as social opportunities that link to the wider world such as elves without having to deal with them directly. It’s not uncommon for tribes to have a sister clan, and for the tribe’s children to call a dwarf uncle and vice versa. In return, they trade in a few different ways, first is the provision of mercs as brute strength when it’s needed particularly in mining ops and warfare, and artefacts (particularly magical) from further afield. They also trade in culture. Tribes culture and artisans cluster around different focuses from nature and you don’t need to move too far across the network to encounter a completely different focus - for example one tribe might focus heavily on the aurorae due to their dominant fire giant lineages, another might focus on thunderous, ruinous sculptures, working forked networks of lightning into their pottery as a tribe with a mixed fire / cloud / earth giant dominant lineage, etc. Hjalmar’s tribe focuses on the stars - a peculiar focus for stone giants but their culture focuses on navigation and connecting lives lived underground with the wider universe above ground. They are particularly reliant on outward travel and diplomacy and their strongest leaders are often the widest travelled. They record their lives and their learnings via star maps denoting interesting directions travelled (and their literal direction). The most decorated maps win campaigns for leadership and status. In competition for such status, there’s no standard format, so an artisanal scarce star field made by a young intelligent pebble of a person can burn just as bright as the exquisite wood carvings of a wise, barnacled old stone. When they find somewhere with more staying power, they carve out and decorate their own caverns with stories from their clan members. Memorialising the adventures and lessons taught by the lives lived among the tribe is key to their culture and recording its learnings. It’s not uncommon for tribes to lead youths through archives of caverns across the world to learn the teachings of their ancestors. They are however splintered and scattered as their tribe explores further and further afield. Often the found tribe is as key to their emotional world as the home tribe, as the socialite navigates the world of humans, dwarves and elves much more smoothly than the loner outcast.

Plot hooks:
- Connection to Vistani traveller at Tser Valley encampment
- Travel the world, collect stories, perform great deeds and record them

> **Roleplaying Information**
> ***Quote.*** "Some fighter you are, getting knocked around like that. First you let your clan down, and now your friends as well. Brave thing you did, rushing into combat like that; stupid, yes, but brave. Maybe a fine warrior somewhere in you. Get up, soldier, we'll show them how it's done."
>
> ***Mannerisms.*** Strokes his beard, looms even though he is short, short, exact movements
>
> ***Speech.*** Mildly Scottish, clipped speech, observations without verbs, low tone.
>
> ***Traits and attitude.*** Gruff drill sergeant who deep down cares about his recruits.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** That Scottish sergeant from Andor
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Appearance.*** A dwarven elder with a massive grey beard, clad in finely crafted plate armour, wielding a huge war hammer.
>
> ***Background.*** Earned the epithet "Stalwart" for never running from a fight; first into the breach, last to leave the battlefield, never left a comrade behind. Fought in a number of local wars, but also as a monster hunter later on. He died trying to defeat Strahd early on, shortly after Barovia fell into the mists.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Seemingly wants to help Pickle grow into the warrior he knows he can be, but secretly is grooming him as his champion, appealing to his sense of wanting to belong as well as his pride, but hoping to feed that so he realises he doesn't need approval, he's better than everyone anyway and he'll make them pay for rejecting him.
>
> ***Relationships.*** A rival to Vampyr and the other Dark powers.
>
> ***Key info.*** Presents himself as an ally to Pickle to teach him how to be a true warrior.

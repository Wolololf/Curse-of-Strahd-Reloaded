Valoria hopes to escape the Domains of Dread by leaving nobody alive to suffer, so Barovia should dissolve and she can return to the Forgotten Realms.

Amber corruption:
- Appearance changes
	- Stage 3: Eyes change to black voids with stars
	- Stage 4: Skin turns paler, almost translucent, blue veins start showing
	- Stage 5: Skin and flesh entirely translucent, lips, gums, tongue and blood all turned to black
- Personality changes
	- Stage 4: I was better off on your own, with just animals for companionship. People don't understand me, and they're just so much effort. I've become more isolated, taciturn, and irritable if pushed.
	- Stage 5: Civilisation was a mistake, nature is better off without intruders.
- Mechanical changes
	- Stage 3:
		- Nature expertise, or Nature + Medicine proficiencies

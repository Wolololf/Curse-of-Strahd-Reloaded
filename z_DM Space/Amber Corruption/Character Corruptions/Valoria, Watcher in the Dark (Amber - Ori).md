> ***Quote.*** "It's harder than it sounded in the songs, h? Keepin' folks safe, and the woods clear of danger. There's terrible things lurking in the dark; help me clear 'em out, protect those who can't protect themselves."

> ***Mannerisms.*** Narrows her eyes, expressive but precise gestures
>
> ***Speech.*** Fast, drops parts of words, informal
>
> ***Traits and attitude.*** Jovial with a dark undertone, mildly mocking, distrustful of strangers, confident

> ***Inspirations.*** TBD
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Appearance.*** Female wood elf wearing a hooded black cloak sprinkled with stars, and a crescent moon necklace; she's armed with a finely crafted longbow and two curved scimitars
>
> ***Background.*** Grew up in a forest with other wood elves, became a huntress. When war came to the forest, tried to defend it but the forest was ultimately burned down, killing most of her clan with her being unable to protect them. Spent years hunting down the perpetrators from the shadows, then spent the next decades slaying monsters and demons that infested various forests and mountain ranges. Eventually came to Barovia while hunting a pack of werewolves, was ambushed in the mists by the werewolves lead by a pale nobleman.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Seemingly aims to help Tavorien protect people and clear this land of darkness, restore the skies; secretly aims to teach Tavorien that people aren't worth protecting, that his self-sacrifice is unappreciated, that everyone has the potential to be corrupted and bring darkness. The ideal state is to turn away from his party, other people and civilisation, and further to nature. The end goal is to make Barovia an uninhabited valley, fruitful, at peace. Valoria hopes to escape the Domains of Dread by leaving nobody alive to suffer, so Barovia should dissolve and she can return to the Forgotten Realms.
>
> ***Relationships.*** A rival to Vampyr and the other Dark powers.
>
> ***Key info.*** Presents herself as an ally to Tavorien to aid him in becoming a protector of the weak.

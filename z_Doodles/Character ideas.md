Eye of the Owlbear

Rising up, back on its feet,
Hit its hide, missed our chances.
Closed the distance, but it's hunting for meat,
Just a beast and its will to survive.

So many times, it happens too fast,
You're in the middle of melee.
-Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past-
You must fight just to keep them alive

It's the eye of the owlbear, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the owlbear

Face to face, out on the heat
Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
They stack the odds still we take to the street
For the kill, with the skill to survive
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
Risin' up, straight to the top
Had the guts, got the glory
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger

> As an action, a creature can use a lit torch or other fire source to light the wick, then throw the bottle up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottle as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. 
> 
> A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.

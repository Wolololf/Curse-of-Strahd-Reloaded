> [!item]+ **Veteran's Cane**
> *Weapon, common*
>
> As a bonus action, you can transform this walking cane into an ordinary Rapier/Shortsword/Longsword (TBD) or change it back into a walking cane. In either case, you must be holding the item.
> 
> While the item itself is magical, its damage does not count as magical; the magic is in the transformation, not in the blade itself.

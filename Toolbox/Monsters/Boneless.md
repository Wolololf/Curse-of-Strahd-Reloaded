<p><strong><em>Compression</em></strong> The boneless can move through any opening at least 1 inch wide without squeezing. It can also squeeze to fit into a space that a <strong><em>Tiny</em></strong> create could fit in.</p>
<p><strong><em>Unusual nature.</em></strong> The boneless doesn't require sleep.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Multiattack.</em></strong> The boneless makes two <strong><em>Slam</em></strong> attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller creature, the create is grappled (escape DC 13), and the boneless can use <strong><em>Crushing Embrace</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><strong><em>Crushing Embrace.</em></strong> The boneless wraps its body around a  Large or smaller creature grappled by it. While the boneless is attached, the target is blinded and unable to breathe. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw at the start of each of the boneless' turns or take 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If something moves the target, the boneless moves with it. The boneless can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to try to detach the boneless and force it to move into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 13 Strength check. When the boneless dies, it detaches from any creature it is attached to.</p>

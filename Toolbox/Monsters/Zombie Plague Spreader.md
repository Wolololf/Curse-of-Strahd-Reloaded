<h3>Traits</h3>
<p><strong><em>Undead Fortitude. (1/day)</em></strong> If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. The zombie can’t use this ability if the damage is radiant or from a critical hit, or if the damage taken is 15 or more.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><strong><em>Slam.</em></strong> <em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <em>Hit:</em> 6 (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
<p><strong><em>Virulent Miasma (1/day).</em></strong>The plague spreader releases toxic gas in a 30-foot-radius sphere centred on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage ends up dying, it rises as a <strong><em>Zombie</em></strong> 1 minute later. The zombie acts immediately after the plague spreader in the initiative count.<br>
The DC for stabilizing a creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way increases to 20.</p>

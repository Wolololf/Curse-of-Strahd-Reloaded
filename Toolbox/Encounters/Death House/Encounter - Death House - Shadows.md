![[Shadow]]

The shadow of the character touching the orb and the nearest ally detach in the first round when initiative starts.
On their turn in the first round, the other shadows just quiver, hiss and admonish players, then detach but don't attack yet.
Each shadow prefers to attack their shadow's source creature.

If the orb is returned, the shadows quiet down and re-attach.

If the orb is destroyed, the shadows immediately take 2d6 radiant damage, every PC within 15 feet of the orb has to make a DC 12 constitution saving throw to take 2d4 necrotic damage, or half that on a save.

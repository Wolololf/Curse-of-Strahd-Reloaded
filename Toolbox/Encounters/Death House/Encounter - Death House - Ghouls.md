![[Ghoul]]

Small ghouls have less health (17 instead of 22) and a lower AC (11 instead of 12), to-hit (+3 instead of +4) and damage (+1 instead of +2)

All ghouls start combat by being semi-submerged in the ground and spend their first turn either attack with disadvantage if an enemy is in range, or clawing their way out of the ground entirely and standing up.

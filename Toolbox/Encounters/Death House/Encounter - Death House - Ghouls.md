![[Ghoul]]

Adjusted to hit and damage:
- Argon: Standard
- Adrik: Standard
- Theren: +2 to hit, 1d6 on Bite, 1d4 on Claw
- Rory: +3 to hit, 1d6+1 on Bite, 1d4+1 on Claw

All ghouls start combat by being semi-submerged in the ground and spend their first turn either attack with disadvantage if an enemy is in range, or clawing their way out of the ground entirely and standing up.

Combat starts with surprise for the ghouls, who roll with advantage and party with disadvantage.
On their first turn, only Argon and Adrik can attack, whoever is in range will do so, the other will spend their turn clawing out of the ground and getting into melee range. Rory emerges from the ground in the distance and also moves into melee range.
On his second turn, Theren emerges from the ground and also moves into range.

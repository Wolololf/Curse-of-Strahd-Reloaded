At the start of the third round of combat, wave 2 starts.
At the start of the fifth round of combat, if needed, Korga (and Kereza?) arrive and take up position on the rooftops.
At the start of the  seventh round of combat, wave 3 starts.

Only replace the other creatures in Wave 3 with the Wight if the battle goes too easily.

Plague spreader approaches players, then unleashes virulent miasma; if close to barricade, Bildrath will leap over, push it back and be downed in the attempt.
Miasma doesn't kill characters, it just increases stabilising DC to 20, but can still use healing.

>
> ***Mannerisms.*** Fidgets with his clothes and hair in the presence of people he admires. Uses a lot more exaggerated facial expressions and considered hand gestures to communicate.
>
> ***Speech.*** Since there is no standard sign language, Parry falls back on commonly understood gestures to make himself understood, but struggles with more complicated subjects. He uses facial expressions to communicate his mood more clearly than others.
> A character using telepathy with him finds him to be soft-spoken and slow, choosing his words with great care.
>
> ***Traits and attitude.*** Curious about outsiders, grieving but trying to be strong, determined to protect his uncle and prove his worth.
>
> ***Inspirations.*** Hodor?
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Appearance.*** A hulk of a man, tall, brawny, but moving with a lightness betraying his size. His shaggy brown hair falls into his face, and he has slightly crooked teeth.
>
> ***Background.*** Parry grew up in the village of Barovia with his family. He was born mute but has learnt to communicate well enough through gestures, and the village is small enough that most people know how to read him well enough. An earnest yet cheerful child, he didn't have many friends his own age, but got on well with older people. He blames himself for his parents' death since they forbid him from fighting on the barricades, but won't let his uncle keep him back now that they're gone.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Parry wants to help his friends and neighbours, take care of his Uncle Bildrath, and honour his late parentsâ€™ memories. On the other hand, he wants to go see the world he's heard so much about in stories.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Parry is an orphan and the nephew of the general-store owner Bildrath Cantemir. His father is Anton Cantemir, his mother Desdrelda Cantemir, both presumed dead but Anton is actually still imprisoned in Castle Ravenloft. Admires Ismark for his leadership and fighting skill, and grieves for Escher whose stories he enjoyed, and Doru who was always kind to him.
>
> ***Key info.*** Can intercede between Bildrath and the party, might sneak them a potion if treated well. Will fight alongside them in the defence.

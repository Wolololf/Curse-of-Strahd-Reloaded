> ***Quote.*** ...
> 
> ***Resonance.*** Parry should inspire sympathy for the loss of his parents, respect for his resilience, capability and bravery, and endearment for his earnest desire to leave the town. At no point should players feel pity for his muteness.
>
> ***Emotions.*** Parry most often feels curiosity, hope, wonder, melancholy, and helplessness.
>
> ***Motivations.*** Parry wants to help his friends and neighbours, take care of his Uncle Bildrath, and honour his late parents’ memories. On the other hand, he wants to go see the world he's heard so much about in stories.

> ***Inspirations.*** TBD
>
> **Character Information**
> ***Appearance.*** A hulk of a man, tall, brawny, but moving with a lightness betraying his size. His shaggy brown hair falls into his face, and he has slightly crooked teeth.
>
> ***Persona.*** To the world, Parry is a cheerful, helpful young man. To those he trusts, Parry is a thoughtful, insightful, yet grieving orphan, desperate to move past his parents’ deaths by proving useful to others.
>
> ***Morale.*** In a fight, Parry would hold up his hands and plead for peace. If ignored, however, he would swiftly use his strength to restrain any combatants—with righteous fury if defending his uncle Bildrath.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Parry is an orphan and the nephew of the general-store owner Bildrath Cantemir. His father is Anton Cantemir, his mother Desdrelda Cantemir, both presumed dead but Anton is actually still imprisoned in Castle Ravenloft. Admires Ismark for his leadership and fighting skill, and grieves for Escher whose stories he enjoyed, and Doru who was always kind to him.
>
> ***Mannerisms.*** Fidgets with his clothes and hair in the presence of people he admires. Uses a lot more exaggerated facial expressions and considered hand gestures to communicate.
>
> ***Speech.*** Since there is no standard sign language, Parry falls back on commonly understood gestures to make himself understood, but struggles with more complicated subjects. He uses facial expressions to communicate his mood more clearly than others.
> A character using telepathy with him finds him to be soft-spoken and slow, choosing his words with great care.

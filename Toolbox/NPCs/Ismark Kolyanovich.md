> ***Background.*** Ismark grew up in the Village of Barovia and was from an early age trained as a leader, to one day take over from his father. Although he is a capable leader, he's always been driven to follow in the footsteps of his ancestor, Ismark the Great, to defeat evil as a great warrior. Secretly, he dreams to leave Barovia behind to explore and adventure, but takes his duty to his people too seriously to ever actually do that. He genuinely believed defending the village was the right plan, but has taken the loss of life hard, and is teetering on the brink of despair, but can't let on his mental state to keep morale up for the rest of the defenders.

> ***Motivations.*** Ismark wants to keep his village and Ireena safe, keep his father's memory alive, and one day match his ancestor's legacy.
>
> ***Relationships.*** Ismark is the adoptive brother of Ireena, the son of Kolyan Indirovich, and the great-grandson of Ismark the Great.
>
> ***Key info.*** Leads the defence of the village, will ask players for aid in protecting the village, and later on Ireena since he cannot leave.

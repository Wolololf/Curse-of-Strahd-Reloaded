> ***Background.*** Grew up in Barovia, father was a drunk, mother died giving birth to his younger brother Anton. Worked hard to raise himself out of poverty and take care of his brother; owns and runs the general store in the village, as well as a small-time alchemist. He stayed behind in the village because his brother and sister-in-law Desdrelda decided to stay, against his advice; when they went missing (presumed dead) during an attack a few days ago, he took in his nephew Parry. He's suffered a lot and hasn't been helped much along the way, he's not expecting anyone to come save him.

> ***Motivations.*** He wants to keep Parry safe as the last good thing in his life, and to give him a better life than he had, but he feels like he's failing to do that. He doesn't care about the village since they didn't care about him.

> ***Relationships.*** Anton's brother, Desdrelda's brother-in-law, and uncle and caretaker to Parry.
>
> ***Key info.*** Runs the only general store in town, opposes Ismark, but will fight on the barricades with Parry and the party.

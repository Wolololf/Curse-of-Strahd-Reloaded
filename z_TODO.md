Later on:
- Early Dark Powers prep for players
	- Powers/boons don't need to be locked in during first encounter
	- Stages
		1. Immediate revival on knockout with full HP
		2. Tally up small assistances, progress once tally hits 5 or 10
			1. Increased AC, attack roll, skill check or save by 1 or 2 (1 point)
			2. Refill spell slot when empty (2 points)
			3. Stabilise immediately (1 point)
		3. First in-person meeting during long rest (on request), pact for exhaustion-based or harm-based spell, mild aplearance changes and one of the following boons
			1. Damage resistance
			2. 2 skill proficiencies
			3. 1 expertise
			4. 5 max HP
			5. +1 AC
		4. Achieved by accepting gift at Amber Temple; appearance changes more severely, mild character flaw, plus following boons:
			1. Spell no longer causes harm, instead CHA save, failure builds corruption, success increases DC
			2. +3 to one stat, or +2 to primary and +1 to secondary
			3. Thematic melee/ranged action which guaranteed increases corruption
		5. Achieved by growing corruption to threshold, additional flaw, severe appearance changes
			1. Passive attribute
			2. Boost of first boon
		6. Corruption complete, character becomes NPC
	- Increase corruption via spell use, giving in to flaws, following patron instructions
	- Decrease corruption by abstaining from spell use and actions, resisting temptation
	- Cure only by greater restoration or similar blessing

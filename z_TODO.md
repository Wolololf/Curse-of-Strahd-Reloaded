Later on:
- Early Dark Powers prep for players
	- Powers/boons don't need to be locked in during first encounter
	- Stages
		1. Immediate revival on knockout with full HP
		2. Tally up small assistances, progress once tally hits 5 or 10
			1. Increased AC, attack roll, skill check or save by 1 or 2 (1 point)
			2. Refill spell slot when empty (2 points)
			3. Stabilise immediately (1 point)
		3. First in-person meeting during long rest (on request), pact for exhaustion-based or harm-based spell, mild aplearance changes and one of the following boons
			1. Damage resistance
			2. 2 skill proficiencies
			3. 1 expertise
			4. 5 max HP
			5. +1 AC
		4. Achieved by accepting gift at Amber Temple; appearance changes more severely, mild character flaw, plus following boons:
			1. Spell no longer causes harm, instead CHA save, failure builds corruption, success increases DC
			2. +3 to one stat, or +2 to primary and +1 to secondary
			3. Thematic melee/ranged action which guaranteed increases corruption
		5. Achieved by growing corruption to threshold, additional flaw, severe appearance changes
			1. Passive attribute
			2. Boost of first boon
		6. Corruption complete, character becomes NPC
	- Increase corruption via spell use, giving in to flaws, following patron instructions
	- Decrease corruption by abstaining from spell use and actions, resisting temptation
	- Cure only by greater restoration or similar blessing

Dream pastries!

Additions and rewrites
- Add skirmishes and smaller custom encounters, stretch out timelines a bit
	- Road encounters (druids, zombies, etc)
	- Potentially smaller themed dungeons for magic items?
- Rebalance some boss fights to have more mobs and less focus on one big bad
	- Vladimir Horngaard: Add reluctant revenants plus phantoms, reduce HP and damage per stage (or remove stage)
	- Kiril: Add weakened werewolves (lower max HP, half regen) plus dire wolves, reduce first stage HP and damage, reduce second stage damage and possible have him rage and attack allies (or have player allies jump in)
	- Leo Dilisnya: Add some ghasts/spectres, reduce first stage HP, then have him absorb the weakest one or two to fuel his second stage

Later on:

	- Stages
		1. Immediate revival on knockout with full HP

			1. Damage resistance
			2. 2 skill proficiencies
			3. 1 expertise
			4. 5 max HP
			5. +1 AC
		4. Achieved by accepting gift at Amber Temple; appearance changes more severely, mild character flaw, plus following boons:
			1. Spell no longer causes harm, instead CHA save, failure builds corruption, success increases DC
			2. +3 to one stat, or +2 to primary and +1 to secondary
			3. Thematic melee/ranged action which guaranteed increases corruption
		5. Achieved by growing corruption to threshold, additional flaw, severe appearance changes
			1. Passive attribute
			2. Boost of first boon
		6. Corruption complete, character becomes NPC
	- Increase corruption via spell use, giving in to flaws, following patron instructions
	- Decrease corruption by abstaining from spell use and actions, resisting temptation
	- Cure only by greater restoration or similar blessing

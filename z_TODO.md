DM prep:
- Re-read death house again
- Roll a Charlatan Fiend Warlock Infernal Tiefling for Gaja

Layout:
- Is ITS + fantasy stat blocks just broken due to readable-line-length?

Session Zero
- Figure put backstory tie-ins
	- Ori
		- Secret Dusk Elf
		- Werewolf attack and collaboration with Esmeralda?
	- Navin
		- Tattoos from Vistani travellers, friend of Stanimir, vistani scarf as arm band
		- Amber shard found on travels?
		- Dragon scale heirloom, stories told of Argynvost's visit?
	- Jack
		- Broken blade of fascinating steel
	- Gaja
		- Amber shard for sure
- Characters:
	- Ori: Wood Elf Beastmaster Ranger
	- Navin: Goliath Rune Knight
	- Gaja: Tiefling Wildfire Druid
	- Jack: Dwarf Wild Magic Sorcerer
- Tie-ins and relics
	- Vistani ancestry (connection to Vistani and Es, scarf relic)
	- Descendant of Silver Dragon
	- Offshoot of Silver Dragon order
		- Both have dragon scale relic
	- Former student of Van Richten, or hunted with Esmeralda
	- Lost family in werewolf attack (enemy of Kirill)
	- Offshoot of the cult of Mother Night
	- Seemingly a Drow, but really in fact a Dusk Elf whose family escaped the slaughter
	- Sent by Lathander to look for Ithuriel (feather of Ithuriel relic)
	- Amber shard inherited or found, or received by a powerful helper in an hour of need
	- Wolfir tooth as good luck charm (druid or ranger), recognised by druids, werewolves and in Soldav
	- Coin of Strahd has always been lucky charm, stolen from a nobleman's mansion, and a clue to find more wealth wherever it came from
	- Sunrise medallion as an arcane focus / holy symbol for good-aligned casters and light/life clerics/paladins
	- Stone crest as an arcane focus for nature casters or forest-dwelling species
	- Broken blade for Dusk Elf characters
	- Raven's feather???
	- Crumpled page???
	- Tattered banner???
	- Foundling after a wolf attack in the forest, lost family in the woods (human female only), replaces Ireena as Izek's sister
	- Ireena stand-in smuggled out of Barovia
- Set expectations
	- Decide soft and hard limits of topics
	- Acting out characters vs being mean

Death house
- Fallback options for players failing or falling unconscious
	- Modified spectre stat block for Rose and Thorn, including healing
	- Modified spectre stat block for Klara
	- Norganas intervention, vague design for first interaction and offer
- Cultist quarters
	- Log book description changes to mention different races
		- Stocky short one suffered in silence
		- Childlike one nearly escaped twice
		- Human swore colourfully
		- Skinny long-eared one screamed and prayed to his god but of course nobody answered
	- Note down rewards
- Rose and Thorn roleplay prep
	- Voices and speech
	- Magic
	- Possession
- Ending prep
	- Farewell scene
	- Wooden horse gift
- Prep fallback if too much unexplored when time runs out
	- Or just remove it because it will force a speed-run instead of exploration?
	- Would resting more than once be so bad? Could be good environmental storytelling
	- The added pressure of a time limit just removes exploration
- Rewrite beginning so no equipment goes missing
	- Also rewrite so players on guard duty, but fog becomes really thick and drowns out other noises, then players in new location
	- Solves problem of long rests by making first session at night, end of day, and makes it spookier
	- Also no chance people won't go to sleep

Later on:
- Dream pastries!

Additions and rewrites
- Add skirmishes and smaller custom encounters, stretch out timelines a bit
	- Road encounters (druids, zombies, etc)
	- Potentially smaller themed dungeons for magic items?
- Rebalance some boss fights to have more mobs and less focus on one big bad
	- Vladimir Horngaard: Add reluctant revenants plus phantoms, reduce HP and damage per stage (or remove stage)
	- Kiril: Add weakened werewolves (lower max HP, half regen) plus dire wolves, reduce first stage HP and damage, reduce second stage damage and possible have him rage and attack allies (or have player allies jump in)
	- Leo Dilisnya: Add some ghasts/spectres, reduce first stage HP, then have him absorb the weakest one or two to fuel his second stage

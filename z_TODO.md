DM prep:
- Re-read death house again
- Campaign intro
	- Gothic horror: Gloomy atmosphere, vampires, werewolves and haunted castles (plus a dragon, lots of witches and some demons), strong sense of place
	- Long running, really evil nemesis and mini-bosses
	- Large cast of characters to befriend or fight
	- Connected story, not a set of one-offs
	- Strong intro, first two chapters aren't just rescuing kittens
- Tooling intro
	- Digital battle maps
	- Hopefully all materials just on the phone, so could still play at the pub if need be

	- Amber shard inherited or found, or received by a powerful helper in an hour of need
	- Wolfir tooth as good luck charm (druid or ranger), recognised by druids, werewolves and in Soldav
	- Coin of Strahd has always been lucky charm, stolen from a nobleman's mansion, and a clue to find more wealth wherever it came from

	- Decide soft and hard limits of topics
	- Acting out characters vs being mean
